## Two Sum

**Approach:**
- Use a hashmap to store numbers and their indices.
- For each number, check if its complement exists.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

## First Unique Character in a String

**Approach:**
- Use a frequency array of size 26 to count characters.
- Traverse the string again to find the first character with frequency 1.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
